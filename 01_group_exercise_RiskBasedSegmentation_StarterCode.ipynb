    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer segmentation involves categorizing the portfolio by industry, location, revenue, account size, and number of employees and many other variables to reveal where risk and opportunity live within the portfolio. Those patterns can then provide key measurable data points for more predictive credit risk management. Taking a portfolio approach to risk management gives credit professionals a better fix on the accounts, in order to develop strategies for better serving segments that present the best opportunities. Not only that, you can work to maximize performance\n",
    "in all customer segments, even seemingly risky segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer segmentation analysis can lead to several tangible improvements in credit risk management: stronger credit policies, and improved internal communication and cooperation across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task scope\n",
    "Your group is working in the retail risk modeling team and you are asked to build a class to perform risk-based segmentation and test it for car loans’ customers based on given historical data of customer behavior. The class must perform the segmentation from a risk management perspective.\n",

So using accuracy makes our analysis for segmentation very short sighted as the result of the analysis could change if one changes the cut-off to let say 40%, for this reason we will use the GINI coeficient which is independent of the cut-off having a better overview of the whole model predictions.\n",
